# 📩 How to Download?

## Redeem Your License Key

If you haven’t already, you’ll need to create an account on the Undetek website and redeem your license key directly [at this link](https://undetek.com/redeem/) before downloading the loader.

## Disable Your Antivirus

Disable all antivirus software, including Windows Defender, before use. Our software may trigger false alerts, but all products are rigorously tested and widely trusted.

## Install Undetek CS2

1\. Download the loader from the Undetek [website](https://undetek.com/my-account/) after redeeming your license.

2\. Run the loader `.exe` as admin to begin the injection process.

3\. The loader will prompt you to open CS2—launch the game if it’s not already running.

4\. Once in-game, press **DEL** or **F8** to open the menu and start customizing your settings.
