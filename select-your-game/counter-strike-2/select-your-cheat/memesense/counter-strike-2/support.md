# 🆘 Support

## Common Issues

**Unsupported platform:** You may have a recent Windows update installed that isn’t currently supported, as Microsoft hasn’t released the necessary binaries yet. To resolve this, you can either [uninstall the update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-uninstall-a-windows-update-c77b8f9b-e4dc-4e9f-a803-fdec12e59fb0) or wait for full compatibility to be added.
