# 📩 How to Download?

## Redeem Your License Key

If you haven’t already, you’ll need to create an account on the [Xone website](https://xone.fun/en/register) and redeem your license key directly at this [link](https://xone.fun/en/home) before downloading the loader.

## Disable Your Antivirus

Disable all antivirus software, including Windows Defender, before use. Our software may trigger false alerts, but all products are rigorously tested and widely trusted.

## Install Xone CS2

1. Download the loader from the [Xone website](https://xone.fun/en/download-launcher).&#x20;
2. Run the loader `.exe` as admin to start the injection process.
3. The loader will prompt you to open CS2—open the game if you haven’t already.
4. Once CS2 is running, press **INSERT** to open the cheat menu and begin customizing your settings.
