# 📩 How to Download?

## Redeem Your License Key

## Install Vanity CS2

2\. Run the loader `.exe` as admin to begin the injection process.

3\. Log in to the loader using your login credentials.

4\. Once you hit Login, the loader will inject and open the game for you automatically.

5\. Once in-game, press **INSERT** to open the menu and start customizing your settings.
