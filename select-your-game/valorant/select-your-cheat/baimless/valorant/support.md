# 🆘 Support

## Common Issues

Baimless may not work correctly if **Windows Defender** or **Windows SmartScreen** are enabled. Since the cheat runs in Kernel Ring 0, these protections often block its drivers, causing errors. To use Baimless without issues, **disable both completely before running the software**.

**Fixes:**
