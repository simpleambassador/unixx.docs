## Order Canceled but Charged?

If your order was canceled but you were charged, it usually means the ZIP code you entered didn’t match your card’s billing address.

Your payment will be automatically refunded within minutes.

When repurchasing, make sure to use the ZIP code registered with your card issuer—even if you’ve moved, this ZIP code may remain the same unless updated by your bank.
