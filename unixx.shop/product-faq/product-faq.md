### Why does my file get deleted? How do I disable antivirus?

Most of our software requires temporarily disabling your antivirus because it may flag false positives. This happens because the software interacts with your system memory, which some antivirus programs mistakenly detect as a threat.

**Don’t worry:** Our software is safe and does not harm your computer.

For step-by-step instructions on how to disable your antivirus, please see:\
[How to Disable Antivirus](how-to-disable-antivirus.md)&#x20;

### Can I use the software on consoles or mobile devices?

No. Our software is designed **exclusively for Windows PC** and is not compatible with consoles or mobile devices.
{% endstep %}

### Are your products lifetime?

It depends on the product you purchase.

Most products have a preset duration—like 7 days or 30 days—and come with a key valid for that time.

We **do not** have recurring monthly subscriptions.

If lifetime products are available, they will be clearly listed at purchase.
