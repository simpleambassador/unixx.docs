## **How to Avoid Report Bans**

Rocket League bans happen only due to abnormal playstyle and accounts receiving a large number of reports. All bans are manual.

* You can buy tracker views to reduce reports and make your account appear more authentic.
* Toggle the AI off sometimes and play normally to avoid mass reports.
* Use Rocket League chat to make other players think you’re not an AI.
* Avoid using auto-queue and auto skip replay tools, as they may look suspicious.

We cannot guarantee you won’t get banned. Bans are related to how legitimate your gameplay appears, not the product itself. Users with older accounts have a lower chance of bans since their accounts seem more authentic. The AI is continually trained to mimic authentic playstyles and minimize bans. Currently, only about 1 in 25 users experience issues, so always use an account you’re okay risking.

## Common Issues

If you crash during setup or injection, simply restart the game and try injecting again. We haven’t seen any in-game crashes so far, but if you do experience one, please open a [support ticket](https://discord.gg/XWBTN8vj4s) and reach out for help.

**Known Issue:**\
If crashes happen after a Bakkesmod “Integrity Update,” try this:

1. Disable all plugins except **Rcon Plugin** and **Bakkesmod Plugin**.
2. If crashes continue, verify your game files or reinstall the game.
