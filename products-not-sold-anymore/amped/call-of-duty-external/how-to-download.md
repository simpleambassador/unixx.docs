# 📩 How to Download?

## Redeem Your License Key

If you haven’t already, you’ll redeem your license key within the loader software after downloading it.

## Disable Your Antivirus

Disable all antivirus software, including Windows Defender, before use. Our software may trigger false alerts, but all products are rigorously tested and widely trusted.

## Enable Virtualization

Enable virtualization in your BIOS before using the Amped External COD software.\
Virtualization is required for the software to run correctly. If it's disabled, crashes or injection issues may occur.

## Disable Secure Boot

Secure Boot can interfere with injection and core functionality. This step is entirely optional but recommended—especially if you play a variety of games beyond Call of Duty.

## Install Amped External COD software

1. Disable Virtualization Based Security, Kernel DMA Security, and TPM in your BIOS.
2. Disable Windows Defender completely using Defender Control: [Download link](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/).
3. Disable any external antivirus software to avoid conflicts with driver loading or injection.
4. Install C++ Redistributables and DirectX Runtimes.
5. Download Riva Tuner for overlay functionality: [Download Here](https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download/).
6. Download the Loader: [Here](https://gofile.io/d/7bZV7o) (WinRAR password: 123).
7. Open Riva Tuner as Administrator.
8. Run loader.exe as Administrator, then log in with your account. If you're new, register and enter your license key.
9. Wait for the injection process to complete, following any prompts provided by the loader.
10. After successful injection, open your selected game and enjoy!

**Final Notes**

1. Always run the loader before launching the game.
2. Keep your game in **Borderless Windowed** mode.
3. If the menu doesn’t appear or you see errors, review each step carefully.
4. For best performance, disable Windows Memory Integrity.
