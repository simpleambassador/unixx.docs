# 📩 How to Download?

## Redeem Your License Key

If you haven’t already, you’ll redeem your license key within the loader software after downloading it.

## Disable Your Antivirus

Disable all antivirus software, including Windows Defender, before use. Our software may trigger false alerts, but all products are rigorously tested and widely trusted.

## Enable Virtualization

Enable virtualization in your BIOS before using the Amped Internal COD software.\
Virtualization is required for the software to run correctly. If it's disabled, crashes or injection issues may occur.

## Disable Secure Boot

Secure Boot can interfere with injection and core functionality. This step is entirely optional but recommended—especially if you play a variety of games beyond Call of Duty.

## Disable Discord Overlay

Discord overlays can cause conflicts and interfere with the software’s injection and performance.

## Install Amped Internal COD software

1. Download the loader [HERE](https://gofile.io/d/G9PMoo).
2. Run the `.exe` as admin before launching COD.
3. Log in with your account. New? Register and enter your license key from your account.
4. Wait for the injection process and follow any loader prompts.
5. After successful injection, launch Call of Duty. The menu button is the Home key.

**Final Notes**

1. Always run the loader before launching the game.
2. Keep your game in **Borderless Windowed** mode.
3. If the menu doesn’t appear or you see errors, review each step carefully.
4. For best performance, disable overlays (Discord, etc.) and Windows Memory Integrity.
