# 🛡️ How to Disable Antivirus

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Why Should I Disable My Antivirus?

Some antivirus software may flag our products as a false positive. This happens because they interact with system memory in ways that resemble malicious behavior — even though our tools are completely safe.

Temporarily disabling your antivirus prevents it from deleting or blocking your files during setup.

### Will Disabling It Give Me a Virus?

**No.** All products on Unixx.Shop are thoroughly tested for safety, stability, and performance.

That said, we **always recommend turning your antivirus back on** after installation to stay protected from unrelated threats.

## When Can I Turn My Antivirus Back On?

You can safely turn your antivirus back on any time you're **not actively using the software**.

However, some antivirus programs may automatically delete the file once protection is re-enabled. To prevent this, we recommend **adding the file or folder as an exclusion** in your antivirus settings. This allows the software to run without being removed.
