# ❌ Invalid HWID

## What is an HWID?

Your **Hardware ID (HWID)** is a unique identifier tied to your PC. It’s used to link your license to your device and prevent unauthorized sharing.

If you're seeing an **Invalid HWID** error, it's usually because you've changed a part of your computer — like upgrading your CPU, motherboard, or reinstalling Windows.

### How do I fix it?

To fix the error, you’ll need to **reset your HWID** so the software can rebind to your current system.

Each product may have a different reset method. Most of the time, you can:

* Find a **reset option** inside the loader
* Use the **product’s website** or dashboard
* Or, create a **support ticket** in the product’s Discord server

If you're unsure where to go, contact us via [discord.gg/unixx](https://discord.gg/unixx) and we’ll help you out.
